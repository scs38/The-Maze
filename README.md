# The Maze

**The Maze** is an interactive story game created in **Twine (Harlowe 3.3.9)**.  
You wake up alone in a mysterious maze â€” no map, no clues, and no memory of how you got there.  
Every choice matters. Some paths lead to freedom, others to endless darkness.  
Can you find your way out?
